Trust me, we wouldnâ€™t want to use it to slacks off at work!

## Introduction

When running the client part, you must make sure that there is a configuration file named `config.json` in the same file path.

The JSON file contains the configuration of the host, port and nickname, so you can set them by modifying this file.

```json
{
  "name": "unknown",
  "HOST": "127.0.0.1",
  "PORT": "8080"
}

// 'HOST' and 'PORT' must be uppercase.
```
